# Learning Go

This repository documents my journey through the book *Introducing Go* by Caleb Doxsey. It includes code snippets, exercises, and projects inspired by the book to solidify my understanding of the Go programming language.

## ðŸ“š About the Book
[*Introducing Go*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-go/9781491941959/) by Caleb Doxsey is a beginner-friendly introduction to the Go programming language. It covers Goâ€™s core syntax, concurrency, networking, and more.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered
As I progress through the book, I will be adding implementations and examples for:
- âœ… Go basics: variables, functions, and control structures
- âœ… Structs and interfaces
- âœ… Concurrency (goroutines & channels)
- âœ… Networking and HTTP servers
- âœ… File I/O and error handling
- âœ… Database interactions

‚úÖ Let‚Äôs walk through the program:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Understanding `defer`**  
   - The `defer` keyword postpones the execution of a function **until the surrounding function (`main()`) exits**.
   - `defer second()` **does not execute immediately**, but it is scheduled to run **just before `main()` returns**.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Execution Order**  
   - `first()` runs **immediately** ‚Üí prints `"1st"`.
   - `third()` runs **immediately** ‚Üí prints `"3rd"`.
   - `second()` (which was deferred) runs **at the end** of `main()`.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Expected Output**:
- Even though `second()` is **declared before `first()` in `main()`**, it runs **last** because it was deferred.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Why Use `defer`?**
- ‚úÖ Ensures that cleanup operations (like **closing files, releasing locks, or disconnecting from databases**) **run at the end** of a function.
- ‚úÖ Useful for maintaining **readable and predictable control flow**.

üìå **Next Steps:**
- ‚úÖ Modify this program to use multiple `defer` calls and see how they execute in **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) order**.
- ‚úÖ Use `defer` to safely **close a file or database connection** in a real-world scenario.
